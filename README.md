# #365DaysChallenge

I created this repository to document my tech journey for the year. This year is pivotal for developing my data science skills, and I also plan to start a journey in software engineering. 

## Week 1 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1  |To kick start the challenge, I used the time to list the certifications I want to get this year, the nature of the projects to work on, and completed the application for a software engineering programme. I plan to devote at least 2 hours every day to keep developing. For the first few weeks of the year, I will continue with the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start learning for the Microsoft Power Platform Associate certification, for which I plan to take the exam in the first half of the year.|
|2  |I resumed the third course (Prepare Data for Exploration) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt and revised topics on unbiased and objective data, identifying good data sources, data ethics and metadata.|

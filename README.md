# #365DaysChallenge

I created this repository to document my tech journey for the year. This year is pivotal for developing my data science skills, and I also plan to start a journey in software engineering. 

## January 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1  |To kick start the challenge, I used the time to list the certifications I want to get this year, the nature of the projects to work on, and completed the application for a software engineering programme. I plan to devote at least 2 hours every day to keep developing. For the first few weeks of the year, I will continue with the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start learning for the Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|2  |I resumed the third course (Prepare Data for Exploration) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt and revised topics on unbiased and objective data, identifying good data sources, data ethics and metadata.| 
|3  |I completed the Prepare Data for Exploration course by learning best practices for organizing data. Practices like establishing naming conventions are seen as less important to many of us. However, this can help a data science or analytics team avoid future confusion, which may lead to a loss of time in clarifying file naming. I also started my journey for the PL 100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|4  |I started the fourth course (Process Data from Dirty to Clean) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt about the importance of data integrity, dealing with insufficient data, determining the best sample size, and why you would not use a whole population but rather get a representative sample (one of the reasons is the cost). Other terms like confidence level and margin of error were understood, as well as how to calculate them. A Google Sheet template was provided to enable easy calculations of the confidence level and margin of error.|
|5  |Continued with the course Process Data from Dirty to Clean. I revised how to use SQL to clean data.|
|6  |I was introduced to using Microsoft Power Automate to generate share links for bulk PDF files and then send a bulk email.|
|7  |Completed the course Process Data from Dirty to Clean by looking at data cleaning verification and working on the practice and final assessments.|
|8  |I began the fifth course in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Analyze Data to Answer Questions) and looked at what the analysis process entails.|
|9  |I learnt and revised key concepts on data validation, conditional formatting and VLOOKUP.|
|10 |I worked on practice exercises and the final assessment to complete the course Analyze Data to Answer Questions in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.|
|11,12,13,14,15|Life happened! Unfortunately, I got sick and was focussing on recovering fully.|
|16 |I'm fully recovered now, and today I assisted my friend with a task he was solving using the Pandas library.|
|17 |I returned to the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, and today I started the sixth course about data visualization. I learnt about why data visualization matters, the art elements, and how to make accessible visualizations using labeling, text alternatives, text-based format, distinguishing, and simplification. I look forward to using Tableau for the first time tomorrow.|
|18 & 19|I revised and practiced SQL. It's been a while since I worked with it, and I had to teach some folks as part of my full-time work. I mainly tackled the basics, and it was great to get back in shape with a bit of SQL practice.|
|20 |I continued with the course Share Data Through the Art of Visualization. Key thing I learnt or let me say revised was the 3 data storytelling steps. The steps include engaging your audience, creating compelling visuals and telling the story in an interesting narrative.|
|21 |Didn't do much today as my plan for the day was to rest. I just read some materials to prep me for the software engineering training program I start in the new week.|
|22 |Couldn't do much again today as I had my lights out for most of the day. Just got myself more acquainted to the software engineering training program I begin today.|
|23,24,25|I have used the past three days to catch up with the orientation exercises for the software engineering program.|
|26-31|I was not able to study for these days. Mainly because of the time constraints I faced. Also, I had to drop out of the software engineering program I joined. I plan to get back to learning stuff on software engineering later in the year.|


## February 
|Day  |Activity|
|---  |--------|
|1-2  |February is here, and I used the first two days to get things in place regarding my learning plans for the month. I plan to finish the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate this month.|
|3	  |Continued with the Share Data Through the Art of Visualization and completed it. I move on to the next course Data Analysis with R Programming. Excited about this course because I know nothing about R Programming. Glad I will have a basic knowledge of R through this course.|
|4-15 |For the past 12 days, I have not been able to log my progress. I have been working on the Data Analysis with R Programming course. It's been great to learn R so far.|
|16   |I learned about using the separate(), unite(), and mutate() functions to transform data.|
|17   |I learned about the bias() function, which is a part of the SimDesign package in R. This function calculates the bias of an estimator. That is how much the estimator tends to over- or under-estimate the true value of the parameter on average.|
|18, 19|Looked at creating visualizations using ggplot2. I created scatterplots as part of my practice exercises.|
|20, 21|I learned how to add aesthetics and facets to visualizations. Hands-on activities were also completed to better understand the process and the syntax required.|
|22   |I moved on to learn how to add annotations such as titles and text using the labs() and annotate() functions. To round out the visualization section, I looked into how to save the visuals that were created.|

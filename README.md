# #365DaysChallenge

I created this repository to document my tech journey for the year. This year is pivotal for developing my data science skills, and I also plan to start a journey in software engineering. 

## Week 1 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1  |To kick start the challenge, I used the time to list the certifications I want to get this year, the nature of the projects to work on, and completed the application for a software engineering programme. I plan to devote at least 2 hours every day to keep developing. For the first few weeks of the year, I will continue with the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start learning for the Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|2  |I resumed the third course (Prepare Data for Exploration) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt and revised topics on unbiased and objective data, identifying good data sources, data ethics and metadata.| 
|3  |I completed the Prepare Data for Exploration course by learning best practices for organizing data. Practices like establishing naming conventions are seen as less important to many of us. However, this can help a data science or analytics team avoid future confusion, which may lead to a loss of time in clarifying file naming. I also started my journey for the PL 100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|4  |I started the fourth course (Process Data from Dirty to Clean) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt about the importance of data integrity, dealing with insufficient data, determining the best sample size, and why you would not use a whole population but rather get a representative sample (one of the reasons is the cost). Other terms like confidence level and margin of error were understood, as well as how to calculate them. A Google Sheet template was provided to enable easy calculations of the confidence level and margin of error.|

# #365DaysChallenge

I created this repository to document my tech journey for the year. This year is pivotal for developing my data analytics/science skills, and my programming skills. 

## January 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1  |To kick start the challenge, I used the time to list the certifications I want to get this year, the nature of the projects to work on, and completed the application for a software engineering programme. I plan to devote at least 2 hours every day to keep developing. For the first few weeks of the year, I will continue with the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start learning for the Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|2  |I resumed the third course (Prepare Data for Exploration) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt and revised topics on unbiased and objective data, identifying good data sources, data ethics and metadata.| 
|3  |I completed the Prepare Data for Exploration course by learning best practices for organizing data. Practices like establishing naming conventions are seen as less important to many of us. However, this can help a data science or analytics team avoid future confusion, which may lead to a loss of time in clarifying file naming. I also started my journey for the PL 100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|4  |I started the fourth course (Process Data from Dirty to Clean) in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I learnt about the importance of data integrity, dealing with insufficient data, determining the best sample size, and why you would not use a whole population but rather get a representative sample (one of the reasons is the cost). Other terms like confidence level and margin of error were understood, as well as how to calculate them. A Google Sheet template was provided to enable easy calculations of the confidence level and margin of error.|
|5  |Continued with the course Process Data from Dirty to Clean. I revised how to use SQL to clean data.|
|6  |I was introduced to using Microsoft Power Automate to generate share links for bulk PDF files and then send a bulk email.|
|7  |Completed the course Process Data from Dirty to Clean by looking at data cleaning verification and working on the practice and final assessments.|
|8  |I began the fifth course in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Analyze Data to Answer Questions) and looked at what the analysis process entails.|
|9  |I learnt and revised key concepts on data validation, conditional formatting and VLOOKUP.|
|10 |I worked on practice exercises and the final assessment to complete the course Analyze Data to Answer Questions in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.|
|11,12,13,14,15|Life happened! Unfortunately, I got sick and was focussing on recovering fully.|
|16 |I'm fully recovered now, and today I assisted my friend with a task he was solving using the Pandas library.|
|17 |I returned to the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, and today I started the sixth course about data visualization. I learnt about why data visualization matters, the art elements, and how to make accessible visualizations using labeling, text alternatives, text-based format, distinguishing, and simplification. I look forward to using Tableau for the first time tomorrow.|
|18 & 19|I revised and practiced SQL. It's been a while since I worked with it, and I had to teach some folks as part of my full-time work. I mainly tackled the basics, and it was great to get back in shape with a bit of SQL practice.|
|20 |I continued with the course Share Data Through the Art of Visualization. Key thing I learnt or let me say revised was the 3 data storytelling steps. The steps include engaging your audience, creating compelling visuals and telling the story in an interesting narrative.|
|21 |Didn't do much today as my plan for the day was to rest. I just read some materials to prep me for the software engineering training program I start in the new week.|
|22 |Couldn't do much again today as I had my lights out for most of the day. Just got myself more acquainted to the software engineering training program I begin today.|
|23,24,25|I have used the past three days to catch up with the orientation exercises for the software engineering program.|
|26-31|I was not able to study for these days. Mainly because of the time constraints I faced. Also, I had to drop out of the software engineering program I joined. I plan to get back to learning stuff on software engineering later in the year.|


## February 
|Day  |Activity|
|---  |--------|
|1-2  |February is here, and I used the first two days to get things in place regarding my learning plans for the month. I plan to finish the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate this month.|
|3	  |Continued with the Share Data Through the Art of Visualization and completed it. I move on to the next course Data Analysis with R Programming. Excited about this course because I know nothing about R Programming. Glad I will have a basic knowledge of R through this course.|
|4-15 |For the past 12 days, I have not been able to log my progress. I have been working on the Data Analysis with R Programming course. It's been great to learn R so far.|
|16   |I learned about using the separate(), unite(), and mutate() functions to transform data.|
|17   |I learned about the bias() function, which is a part of the SimDesign package in R. This function calculates the bias of an estimator. That is how much the estimator tends to over- or under-estimate the true value of the parameter on average.|
|18, 19|Looked at creating visualizations using ggplot2. I created scatterplots as part of my practice exercises.|
|20, 21|I learned how to add aesthetics and facets to visualizations. Hands-on activities were also completed to better understand the process and the syntax required.|
|22   |I moved on to learn how to add annotations such as titles and text using the labs() and annotate() functions. To round out the visualization section, I looked into how to save the visuals that were created.|
|23-26|Completed the Data Analysis with R Programming course by learning about documentation and reports. Learned how to use R markdown in particular.|
|27-28|Began work on the final capstone project. Progress has been slow, but I'm hoping to get it done in the next couple of days.|


## March 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1-9|I spent the first nine days of the month completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Course. Glad I was able to finally complete it, and I learned new stuff in the process.|
|10-14|I was not well and spent these days recovering. My health is everything to me. Without good health, we cannot achieve all the goals we set for ourselves.| 
|15 |I have gained free access to Datacamp and Coursera for a limited period. I plan to use this opportunity to enhance my skills in working with data. I will also be working on projects and then start intensive learning for the PL 100: Microsoft Power Platform App Maker certification.|
|16-26|I forgot to update my progress. Will be doing that consistently in April.|
|27 |I practiced with the set_index, reset_index, and sort_index methods in Pandas. Also looked at multi-level index (also known as hierarchical index).|
|28 |Continued to practice slicing and subsetting with .loc and .iloc methods in Pandas.|
|29-30|Worked on practice problems using .loc and .iloc methods on pivot tables in Pandas|
|31 |Took a break to end the first quarter of the year.|


## April 
|Day|Activity|
|---|--------|
|1-2|I reviewed my progress for the first quarter and planned for the second quarter of the year. I must work hard and stay consistent to achieve a lot this quarter. I'll have a great April!|
|3  |I learned and practiced creating and visualizing DataFrames. I looked at how to create visuals such as a scatter plot, bar chart, line plot, histogram, and box plot. I also looked at how to handle missing values with the .isna method. I captured everything by reading and writing CSV files with Pandas.|
|4  |To develop my programming skills in Python, I am reading a famous Python book (Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes). I've completed the first chapter, and I'm midway through the second chapter. The interesting thing I picked up is using underscores in numbers. This was something I didn't know about, so it was fun finding out about it. Another key point was using capital letters for constants. An example of the underscores in numbers in image below. <p align="center"> <picture>Example: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74061999/229935230-5dd84128-fec4-4db9-b287-1fc90cf42ae8.png)</picture> </p>|
|5  |I planned my studies for the evening but unfortunately had a power cut and did not study.|
|6  |I was also not able to study today. I am glad about the upcoming holidays and expect to make good progress.|
|7  |I read about the Zen of Python. It is interesting, and I agree that simple is always better than complex.|
|8  |Completed the first chapter of a book I'm reading on data analysis and decision-making.|
|9  |Worked on a project investigating Netflix movies to determine if the duration of movies has decreased in recent years. This project is a guided project by Datacamp.|
|10 |I learned how to merge DataFrames in Pandas with an inner join. I then looked at how to combine multiple DataFrames into a single DataFrame.The merge() method makes it possible to do this and has the suffixes attribute, which is very helpful when a column is present in both DataFrames you are combining. I also continued with the Python book and went through lists today: how to create them, add elements to a list using the append() and insert() methods, and the difference between these two. Further read and practiced how to remove elements from a list using the del statement, pop() method, and remove() method. I was glad to understand when to use either of these three. Good progress today. We continue tomorrow. Good Easter break and holidays overall.|
